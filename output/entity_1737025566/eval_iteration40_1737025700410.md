Certainly! However, I currently don't have access to the timeline of Kaelith Xyvar or its narrative details. If you provide me with the timeline or a summary of the narrative, I can analyze it in-depth using the criteria you've described. Once you share the details, Iâ€™ll craft a structured evaluation with an overall score, breakdown, and entity graph.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
