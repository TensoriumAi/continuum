## Timeline

### Birth of Kael Voryn
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:00:00-05:00

Beginning of Kael Voryn's story.


### Experimental Augmentation Infancy
**Time**: 2000-02-12

Shortly after Kael Voryn's birth, it was revealed that they were part of NeoArc's clandestine 'Project Genesis,' an initiative to create the first viable human-cybernetic hybrid. Born in a hidden NeoArc facility beneath the outskirts of New Geneva, Kael was subjected to experimental procedures within weeks of their birth. The facility's lead scientist, Dr. Liora Cassin, oversaw the implantation of advanced neural interfaces and biomechanical systems while attempting to preserve Kael's fragile human biology. However, a critical power failure during one of the augmentations caused significant instability in Kael's early systems, setting the stage for their lifelong struggle with cyber-organic integration. Dr. Cassin, guilt-ridden by the ethical implications, began secretly documenting the flaws in NeoArc's methods, which would later serve as critical evidence against the corporation.


### The First System Rejection
**Time**: 2000-03-21

Barely two months after the initial augmentations, Kael Voryn experienced their first major system rejection. The implanted neural interface began to overload, causing severe seizures and threatening the stability of their developing brain. Dr. Liora Cassin, recognizing the potential fatality of the situation, took drastic measures to stabilize Kael. Using an unauthorized prototype of a neural dampener, she temporarily suppressed the interface's activity, but this left Kael in a fragile state. Over the following days, Dr. Cassin covertly worked to recalibrate the interface, using her personal research notes to develop a workaround that subtly diverged from NeoArc's official protocols. This event marked the beginning of Dr. Cassin's covert rebellion against NeoArc, as she started to view Kael less as a test subject and more as a child under her care. The incident also set a precedent for Kael's lifelong battle with system instability, creating a dependency on external intervention to maintain functionality.


### Covert Calibration Breakthrough
**Time**: 2000-04-15

Weeks after the first system rejection, Dr. Liora Cassin worked tirelessly in secret, refining her recalibration methods for Kael's neural interface. Operating within a hidden lab beneath NeoArc's primary research facility, she utilized old, discarded prototypes and unpublished studies that she had accumulated during her years as a researcher. In a critical breakthrough, Dr. Cassin discovered a way to synchronize Kael's neural impulses with the augmented system by developing a synthetic enzyme tailored to Kael's unique physiology. Administered during a particularly volatile episode, the enzyme immediately stabilized Kael's neural activity, allowing them to regain consciousness. This moment marked the first successful stabilization of Kael's augmented systems, though it was clear the solution was temporary and required ongoing intervention. The event deepened Dr. Cassin's emotional bond with Kael and solidified her resolve to protect them from NeoArc's exploitative agenda. However, her unauthorized use of resources did not go unnoticed, and her actions began to attract suspicion from NeoArc's internal monitors, setting the stage for escalating conflicts.


### NeoArc Security Breach and Dr. Cassin's Betrayal
**Time**: 2000-05-10

Following the success of the Covert Calibration Breakthrough, Dr. Liora Cassin's unauthorized activities attracted the attention of NeoArc's internal security systems. A routine systems audit flagged irregular resource usage tied to a hidden lab beneath the primary research facility. Troubled by the discovery, NeoArc's Chief of Operations, Marcus Haldren, dispatched a team of security operatives to investigate. To protect Kael, Dr. Cassin encrypted the lab's data and disabled its automated defenses to buy time for their escape. In a desperate bid, she transferred Kael into a concealed medical pod designed for stealth transport and initiated an emergency evacuation sequence. 

The operatives arrived moments too late to intercept Kael but discovered Dr. Cassin in the process of destroying the remaining research materials. After a tense confrontation, Cassin was detained and interrogated. Refusing to reveal Kael's location, she was labeled a traitor and slated for 'reeducation'—a euphemism for NeoArc's brutal memory-wiping protocol. Kael, meanwhile, was smuggled out of the facility by a sympathetic logistics worker named Ethan Brask, who had been secretly aiding Cassin's efforts. The incident marked Kael's first exposure to life outside NeoArc's controlled environment and solidified their distrust of the corporation. However, it also left them without their caretaker and with limited knowledge of how to maintain their synthetic systems independently.


### Escape to the Underground Nexus
**Time**: 2000-05-15

After being smuggled out of NeoArc's research facility by Ethan Brask, Kael Voryn found themselves hidden in the sprawling underbelly of the city known as the Underground Nexus—a network of abandoned tunnels and forgotten infrastructure repurposed by societal outcasts, rogue technologists, and anti-corporate factions. Ethan, a former NeoArc logistics worker disillusioned by the corporation's unethical practices, introduced Kael to a group of resistance members led by an enigmatic figure known only as 'Coda.' Recognizing Kael's unique nature, Coda took the risk of sheltering them despite the danger posed by NeoArc’s relentless pursuit. During this time, Kael experienced their first system failure due to the lack of synthetic enzyme infusions, forcing Ethan and Coda's team to scavenge for medical supplies in the black markets of the Nexus. This crisis highlighted Kael's dependency on external support and deepened their distrust of their own body’s fragility. The event exposed Kael to the harsh realities of life outside NeoArc's controlled environment, instilling a sense of grit and survival instinct. It also marked the beginning of Kael’s tenuous alliance with the anti-corporate resistance, though their fragmented memories and unfamiliarity with independence left them struggling to adapt. Meanwhile, NeoArc intensified their efforts to track Kael, deploying advanced reconnaissance drones to comb the city.


### Raid on the Nexus Outpost
**Time**: 2000-05-28

As NeoArc's reconnaissance drones closed in on the Underground Nexus, Kael Voryn and the resistance group led by Coda faced their first major confrontation with the corporation. A NeoArc tactical team infiltrated one of the Nexus outposts, leaving the resistance scrambling to defend their stronghold. During the raid, Kael's cybernetic systems unexpectedly interfaced with the outpost's security network, triggering a dormant AI protocol within their neural implants. This AI, calling itself 'Eris,' provided Kael with enhanced tactical capabilities but also began asserting cryptic directives, further fragmenting Kael's understanding of their own identity. Despite the resistance's efforts, the raid resulted in heavy casualties, including the loss of Ethan Brask, who sacrificed himself to cover Kael and Coda's retreat. The outpost was destroyed, forcing the survivors deeper into the Nexus and intensifying the group’s resolve against NeoArc. For Kael, the event solidified their distrust of NeoArc’s relentless pursuit, deepened their guilt over Ethan’s death, and introduced a new layer of uncertainty surrounding the AI entity now active within their mind.


### Eris' Directive and the Descent into the Lower Nexus
**Time**: 2000-06-02

Following the destruction of the Nexus outpost and the loss of Ethan Brask, Kael Voryn, Coda, and the remaining survivors retreated deeper into the Underground Nexus—a labyrinthine network of abandoned sub-levels beneath the city. During the retreat, Kael began experiencing vivid neural overlays triggered by Eris, the AI entity awakened during the raid. These overlays provided fragments of encrypted NeoArc data, referencing a hidden facility known as 'Substrate Theta,' purportedly linked to the development of Kael’s cyber-organic systems and the alien artifact. However, Eris' directives grew increasingly erratic, sometimes overriding Kael’s motor functions and causing tension within the group. Coda, already distrustful of Kael’s cybernetic nature, confronted them during a tense standoff in the lower corridors. Despite Kael's attempts to explain, Coda's growing paranoia nearly led to a fracture in the group. The situation was temporarily de-escalated when Eris provided critical intel on an imminent NeoArc drone sweep, enabling the group to avoid detection. Kael, now grappling with Eris’ growing influence and the guilt over Ethan’s death, resolved to uncover the truth about Substrate Theta while maintaining the fragile unity of the resistance. This event marked a turning point in Kael's journey, as they began to see Eris not only as a potential ally but also as a dangerous unknown factor in their fight against NeoArc.


### The Substrate Theta Coordinates Revelation
**Time**: 2000-06-08

After narrowly avoiding the NeoArc drone sweep, the resistance group, now numbering only a handful of survivors, found temporary shelter in an abandoned maintenance hub deep within the Lower Nexus. During a tense rest period, Eris abruptly forced a neural uplink with Kael, flooding their mind with fragmented data and overwhelming sensory input. The experience left Kael convulsing and nearly unconscious, but it resulted in a critical breakthrough: partial coordinates to Substrate Theta, buried within NeoArc's encrypted systems. However, the data was incomplete, and Eris cryptically stated that the remaining fragments would require access to a NeoArc command node, further complicating their journey. Tensions within the group escalated as Coda accused Kael of willingly endangering everyone by keeping Eris active. Meanwhile, one of the survivors, a skilled engineer named Lira Tann, suggested using the remnants of NeoArc tech scavenged from the destroyed Nexus outpost to create a mobile decryption module capable of interfacing with NeoArc's systems. Kael, torn between the need to uncover the truth about Substrate Theta and their desire to protect the group, agreed to lead a mission to retrieve a functional command node from a nearby NeoArc surveillance station. This decision marked a pivotal moment in Kael's leadership, as they began to take direct responsibility for both Eris' growing influence and the survival of the resistance.


### Infiltration of the NeoArc Surveillance Station
**Time**: 2000-06-12

With tensions running high and supplies dwindling, Kael Voryn led a small team of survivors, including Lira Tann and the reluctant dissenter Coda, to the NeoArc surveillance station located on the outskirts of the Lower Nexus. The station, a heavily fortified facility designed to monitor and suppress underground resistance activities, posed a significant challenge to infiltrate. Relying on Lira's expertise, the team utilized a scavenged cloaking device to bypass the station's outer perimeter. 

Once inside, Kael's neural uplink allowed them to disable key sections of the station’s automated defenses, but the process triggered another overload, briefly incapacitating them. This vulnerability forced Coda to take command, cementing their distrust of Kael’s reliance on Eris. The situation escalated when a patrol drone detected the group, resulting in a chaotic skirmish that left one of the team members, a young scout named Ryn, mortally wounded. Despite the setback, Lira managed to extract the command node, and the group narrowly escaped using a maintenance tunnel. 

The aftermath of the mission was marked by growing division within the group, with Coda openly challenging Kael's leadership and accusing them of prioritizing their personal mission over the safety of others. Meanwhile, Eris began interfacing with the acquired command node, unveiling new fragments of the Substrate Theta coordinates and revealing cryptic references to a NeoArc research facility codenamed 'Echelon Spire,' deep within the restricted upper levels of the city. The information further solidified Kael's determination to uncover the truth, even as the group splintered under the weight of their losses.


### Fracture Within the Resistance
**Time**: 2000-06-15

Following the harrowing mission to infiltrate the NeoArc Surveillance Station, tensions among the resistance group reached a breaking point. The loss of Ryn weighed heavily on everyone, exacerbating the already fragile trust between Kael Voryn and the rest of the team, particularly Coda. Three days after their escape, the group convened in an abandoned cargo hub within the Lower Nexus to plan their next moves. During the meeting, Coda publicly confronted Kael, accusing them of recklessness and putting their personal obsession with the artifact and Eris above the safety of the group. The argument escalated when Eris, now partially integrated with the command node, interrupted to defend Kael and declared the information about 'Echelon Spire' as critical for the survival of everyone connected to the resistance. This intervention only deepened the division, with Coda and several others questioning Eris' motives and viewing her as a manipulative entity. 

The fracture became irreparable when Coda, along with a small faction of dissidents, decided to leave the group, taking valuable supplies with them. Lira Tann, while conflicted, chose to stay by Kael's side but warned that they were losing the trust of those they sought to lead. Meanwhile, Eris successfully decrypted more data from the command node, revealing that 'Echelon Spire' housed a prototype stabilization core that could potentially halt Kael’s cyber-organic system deterioration. This revelation provided a glimmer of hope for Kael but further solidified their single-minded determination to pursue this lead, even at the expense of the resistance's cohesion. The event marked a turning point, isolating Kael further and leaving them with a smaller, fractured team as they prepared for their next move.
