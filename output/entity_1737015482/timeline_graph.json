This led to the initiation of a quest for a device known as the 'Temporal Compass,' which is believed to provide its user with the ability to navigate the multiverse. The search culminated on February 10, 2015, when entity_1737015482 managed to procure the Temporal Compass from a hidden dimension known as the 'Timeless Vault'. This acquisition marked a significant step in entity_1737015482's journey, dramatically enhancing their ability to travel across dimensions and setting them on a more direct path to their ultimate goal: Defeating The Maw.",
