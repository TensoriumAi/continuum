Beginning of Zorak Starborn's story.


### Zorak's First Telekinetic Event
**Time**: 2000-01-17T00:00:00-05:00

Just a day after his birth, Zorak Starborn showcased a glimmer of his powerful telekinetic abilities. The objects in his nursery, located in the royal Zorgonian palace on Zorgon VII, began to levitate and orbit around him, causing a mixture of awe and alarm among the Zorgonian Court. This event marked the first manifestation of Zorak's telekinetic abilities, solidifying his position as a powerful member of the Zorgonian species and setting the stage for his future struggles to control his potent powers.


### Zorak's Telekinetic Training Begins
**Time**: 2000-01-18

Recognizing the immense potential and the inherent danger of Zorak's telekinetic abilities, the Zorgonian Court decided to initiate early training to help him control his powers. They recruited the esteemed telepath, M'zarth, known for his abilities to guide and nurture young telekinetics. M'zarth moved into the royal Zorgonian palace to become Zorak's personal mentor. The training was rigorous and often overwhelming for young Zorak, but it marked the start of his journey towards mastering his abilities. This event significantly altered Zorak's childhood, replacing traditional play and education with intense telekinetic training. It also instilled in him a strong discipline and a sense of responsibility towards his powers.


### Zorak's First Telekinetic Milestone
**Time**: 2000-02-22

After a month of intense training under M'zarth, Zorak reached a significant milestone in his telekinetic journey. He successfully manipulated multiple objects simultaneously via telekinesis while maintaining perfect control, a feat unusual for his young age. This achievement was celebrated by the Zorgonian Court as an indication of his rapid progress. However, it also led to an increased pressure on Zorak to perform and prove himself. The event marked a shift in the Zorgonian Court's expectations, making Zorak's path towards mastering his abilities more challenging. Despite the pressure, Zorak was determined to live up to the expectations and continue his training.


### Zorak's First Telekinetic Performance
**Time**: 2000-03-01

Following the success of his first telekinetic milestone, Zorak was invited to give a performance at the Zorgonian Court to demonstrate his abilities. The court was filled with high-ranking Zorgonians, including Emperor Zorgus IV and the entire Council of Elders. The event was highly anticipated due to Zorak's recent achievement. After preparing with M'zarth, Zorak successfully manipulated an intricate display of floating crystals, forming patterns and shapes in the air that left the audience in awe. His performance was met with thunderous applause and further solidified his reputation as a prodigy. However, the event also heightened the expectations placed on Zorak, intensifying the pressure he felt to master his abilities. The performance marked a new chapter in Zorak's life as he became a figure of interest in the Zorgonian Court, drawing both admiration and envy.


### Zorak's Initiation into the Council of Elders
**Time**: 2000-03-15

Impressed by Zorak's telekinetic performance at the court, Emperor Zorgus IV, with the majority vote of the Council of Elders, decided to officially initiate Zorak into their esteemed ranks. This was an unprecedented move due to Zorak's age, but his exceptional telekinetic prowess and potential marked him out as an extraordinary individual. On the 15th of March, a ceremonial gathering was held at the grand Zorgonian Senate Chamber, where Zorak, accompanied by his mentor M'zarth, was given the traditional robe of the Elders and a seat on the council. His induction was met with a mix of admiration and resentment from the Zorgonian court and other council members. While many saw Zorak's inclusion as a progressive step, others perceived it as a threat to the established order. The event marked a significant turning point in Zorak's life, as he was now exposed to the political intricacies of the Zorgonian empire and became a key decision-maker. This initiation added another layer of responsibility and challenge to his goal of mastering his telekinetic abilities.


### Zorak's First Council Decision
**Time**: 2000-04-01

On the 1st of April, barely two weeks after his induction into the Council of Elders, Zorak faced his first major test. The Zorgonian empire was under threat from the rebellious Krillixian race, who were planning an uprising. The council was divided between a diplomatic approach and a military intervention. With the council vote evenly split, the decision fell upon Zorak, the newest member. Despite the pressure, Zorak opted for diplomacy, suggesting a peace treaty and negotiations with the Krillixian leaders. His decision was met with surprise by many, but Emperor Zorgus IV supported Zorak's initiative, appreciating his wisdom and maturity beyond his years. This event not only solidified Zorak's position in the council but also set a precedent for his preference for peace over conflict. It was a profound moment that further emphasized the challenges of his new role and his commitment to maintaining peace in the Zorgonian empire.


### Zorak's Peace Negotiations with Krillixians
**Time**: 2000-06-10

On June 10th, following Zorak's decision to engage diplomatically with the Krillixian race, he led a delegation to the Krillixian home planet, Krillix IV. With him were other members of the Council of Elders, including Emperor Zorgus IV. There, they met with the Krillixian leaders, a coalition of high-ranking generals and elders, led by General Krillixor. After tense negotiations lasting several days, Zorak managed to broker a peace treaty between the Zorgonian empire and the Krillixian race. The treaty, known as 'The Pact of Zorak', included terms of disarmament and trade agreements beneficial for both sides. Zorak's successful negotiations demonstrated his diplomatic skills and further established his reputation as a peacemaker, a stark contrast to the militaristic tendencies of past council members. His efforts also brought about a temporary period of peace and stability within the Zorgonian empire, further reinforcing Zorak's belief in diplomacy over conflict.


### Zorak's Recognition by the Intergalactic Peace Council
**Time**: 2000-07-12

Following the successful peace negotiations with the Krillixians on June 10th, word of Zorak's diplomatic prowess spread across the cosmos. On July 12th, Zorak was invited to the Intergalactic Peace Council, an influential assembly of peacekeepers from various galaxies. The council held a ceremony on their headquarters, located on the neutral planet of Paxus Prime, to honor Zorak's efforts in brokering the 'Pact of Zorak'. Zorak was awarded the 'Star of Pax', the highest honor given by the council for extraordinary diplomatic achievements. The recognition elevated Zorak's status among his peers and across different galaxies, solidifying his reputation as a peacemaker. It also marked the beginning of Zorak's increased involvement in intergalactic diplomacy, expanding his original goal of maintaining peace within the Zorgonian empire to promoting peace across the universe.


### Zorak's First Intergalactic Diplomatic Mission
**Time**: 2000-08-01

Following his recognition by the Intergalactic Peace Council, Zorak was assigned his first intergalactic diplomatic mission. The mission was to mediate a conflict between the warring races of the Andromeda system, the Cygnoids and the Pulsarians. Utilizing his telepathic abilities and diplomatic skills, Zorak managed to broker a truce between the two races, known as the 'Andromeda Accord'. The successful mission cemented his reputation as an effective peacekeeper across multiple galaxies. Zorak's diplomatic efforts led to a period of relative peace within the Andromeda system, increasing the respect and influence of the Zorgonian empire in the process. This event also marked the beginning of Zorak's career as an intergalactic diplomat, further expanding his original goal of maintaining peace within the Zorgonian empire to promoting peace across the universe.


### The Andromeda Peaceful Era
**Time**: 2000-09-01

After the successful 'Andromeda Accord', the Andromeda system entered a month-long period of peace, known as 'The Andromeda Peaceful Era'. This was a rare moment of tranquility in a system that had been plagued by conflict for centuries. The truce between the Cygnoids and the Pulsarians held strong, largely due to the respect both races had for Zorak following the negotiations. This period saw an increase in trade and inter-species cooperation, leading to economic growth and prosperity within the Andromeda system. The Zorgonian empire, particularly Zorak, was highly praised for this achievement, leading to greater influence and respect for the empire in the intergalactic community. This event played a crucial role in affirming Zorak's commitment to promoting peace across the universe, not just within his native Zorgonian empire.
