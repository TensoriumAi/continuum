## Timeline

### The Shattering of Qlithar Prime
**Time**: 2000-01-16

Vaelith Quorran's birth coincided with a catastrophic event on their homeworld, Qlithar Prime. The planet's unstable core, weakened by centuries of over-mining for rare meteorite minerals essential to the Qlithari diet, underwent a violent collapse. The Qlithari Council had been warned of this possibility years prior but dismissed the concerns as improbable. The event triggered massive tectonic upheavals across Qlithar Prime, destroying major cities and displacing millions. Vaelith's parents, Aelora and Thynar Quorran, were among the few who survived the initial shockwave due to their location in a remote research facility studying ancient relics. Vaelith was born amidst the chaos, under dim emergency lights, with their parents using improvised medical equipment to ensure their survival. The birth was seen by those present as a symbol of hope for their species, but the destruction of their world left the Qlithari scattered among the stars.


### The Collapse of the Resonant Spire
**Time**: 2000-01-16

As the Shattering of Qlithar Prime unfolded, the Resonant Spire, an ancient construct believed to house the core glyphs of Qlithari heritage, became unstable due to the planet's tectonic upheavals. This monumental structure, located in the heart of the capital city Aetherion, was both a cultural and technological beacon for the Qlithari people. The collapse triggered a massive release of harmonic energy, which resonated across the planet and caused unpredictable reactions in nearby relics. Vaelith's parents, Aelora and Thynar Quorran, who were stationed at a remote research facility, noted the harmonic surge and realized its synchronicity with the birth of Vaelith. This event not only disrupted the already chaotic evacuation efforts but also scattered fragments of the Resonant Spire across Qlithar Prime, embedding key glyphs and relics deep within the planet's ruins. Survivors later recounted seeing the spire's collapse as an omen of their civilization's fragmentation. For Vaelith, this event marked the beginning of their mysterious connection to the ancient Qlithari relics, as it was discovered that the harmonic surge stabilized the research facility, allowing their survival.


### Birth of Vaelith Quorran
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:00:00-05:00

Beginning of Vaelith Quorran's story.


### The Resonant Surge
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:00:10-05:00

Moments after Vaelith Quorran's birth, a sudden and unprecedented harmonic surge erupted from the Resonant Glyph buried deep beneath the Resonant Spire. The energy wave destabilized the already collapsing environment of Qlithar Prime, creating a cascading series of harmonic quakes that reverberated across the planet. Witnesses present at Vaelith's birth, including High Curator Lirith Voshen and Resonant Engineer Kaelor Thryne, noted that the harmonic surge seemed to synchronize with Vaelith's unique resonance energy, amplifying its effects. The surge caused the Resonant Glyph to emit a bright, shifting light pattern and an otherworldly melody, which survivors later interpreted as an ancient Qlithari prophecy. This event marked the first indication of Vaelith's extraordinary connection to Qlithari relics, hinting at their pivotal role in the species' survival. However, the surge also triggered tectonic instability that accelerated the collapse of the Resonant Spire and further endangered the surrounding area, forcing an immediate evacuation.


### The Eruption of the Resonant Glyph
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:00:30-05:00

Moments after Vaelith Quorran's birth, the Resonant Glyph—a massive ancient artifact buried deep within the core of Qlithar Prime—erupted with a surge of harmonic energy. This energy cascaded across the crumbling planet, causing a rare phenomenon where ancient Qlithari glyphs inscribed in the Resonant Spire and surrounding structures glowed intensely before shattering. Present at Vaelith's birth were their caretaker, Elder Aeylin Xarith, a revered Qlithari historian, and a small group of survivors who had sought refuge in the Resonant Spire's subterranean chambers. The eruption stabilized the immediate area for a brief moment, allowing the small group to survive the chaos. However, the energy surge also triggered the Resonance Quake, further destabilizing the planet. Elder Xarith interpreted the event as a sign that Vaelith was connected to the ancient relics on a fundamental level, marking them as a potential savior or harbinger for their species. This moment deepened the survivors' resolve to protect Vaelith at all costs, despite the planet's imminent destruction.


### The Resonance Quake
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:01:00-05:00

Moments after Vaelith Quorran's birth, a powerful, unseen force emanated from their fragile body, causing a localized seismic event within the underground birthing chamber on Qlithar Prime. The Resonance Quake disrupted the chamber's crystalline architecture, cracking the ancient walls and exposing hidden Qlithari glyphs that glowed faintly with a harmonic resonance. The attending Qlithari midwife, Lyssara Jainth, and a group of six survivors witnessed the event in awe and terror. Several of the glyphs began rearranging themselves into a pattern that none of the witnesses recognized, hinting at an ancient prophecy. The seismic disturbance also destabilized the area, forcing the group to evacuate deeper into the tunnels. This event marked the first manifestation of Vaelith's unique connection to the Qlithari relics and hinted at their potential to unlock ancient mysteries.


### The Resonance Pulse
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:01:00-05:00

Moments after Vaelith Quorran's birth, a wave of harmonic energy, later termed the 'Resonance Pulse,' surged outward from their location. This pulse stabilized the crumbling tectonic plates of Qlithar Prime for several precious minutes, allowing a number of Qlithari to escape immediate peril. The event was witnessed by a small group of survivors, including Elder Saelith Vrenn, the last surviving member of the Qlithari Council, who interpreted it as a divine signal tied to the ancient relics. The Resonance Pulse also triggered the activation of dormant Qlithari artifacts scattered across the collapsing planet, including the Stellar Conflux Key, which would later play a critical role in the species' escape. However, the energy released began to destabilize Vaelith's physiology, forcing the attending medic, Teyrin Khal, to utilize an ancient resonance stabilizer to ensure their survival.


### The Glyph's Refrain
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:02:30-05:00

As the group of survivors scrambled to move deeper into the unstable tunnels following the Resonance Quake, the rearranged glyphs on the fractured crystalline walls began emitting a low, harmonic tone. This sound resonated with Vaelith Quorran's faint cries, forming a complex melody that seemed to calm the group despite the chaos surrounding them. Lyssara Jainth, the midwife, cautiously approached the glowing glyphs and noticed her crystalline communicator was also reacting, translating fragments of an ancient Qlithari dialect: 'The Harbinger of Renewal awakens.' This cryptic message, combined with the glyphs' melody, caused a mix of awe and confusion among the survivors. The harmonic tone, however, also attracted the attention of scavengers lurking in the tunnels—creatures displaced by the Shattering of Qlithar Prime. The group prepared to defend themselves, but as the creatures approached, Vaelith emitted a second, weaker resonance pulse that repelled the attackers, causing them to retreat into the shadows. The survivors interpreted this as a sign of Vaelith's significance, cementing their protective role over the newborn. The event left an indelible mark on Lyssara, who began to suspect that Vaelith's abilities were intertwined with the ancient prophecies of the Qlithari's restoration.


### The Glyph's Whisper
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:05:00-05:00

As the survivors, led by Lyssara Jainth, began their retreat deeper into the tunnels following the Resonance Quake, the glowing glyphs left behind in the shattered birthing chamber began emitting a faint harmonic hum. Moments later, a single glyph detached itself from the crystalline wall, hovering mid-air before dissolving into an ethereal stream of light that spiraled toward Vaelith Quorran. Upon contact, the light imprinted itself onto Vaelith's skin in the form of a shifting, iridescent mark on their chest. This event, later referred to as 'The Glyph's Whisper,' left the survivors in stunned silence. Lyssara and another elder survivor, Jorven Thal, theorized that the glyph's behavior was a direct response to Vaelith's resonance energy, marking them as a key to unlocking the secrets of the Qlithari relics. However, the event also triggered a subtle but growing instability in the surrounding crystalline tunnels, forcing the group to accelerate their evacuation. Vaelith's unique imprint became a subject of both hope and fear among the survivors, solidifying their role as a potential savior while also painting a target on their back for those who might seek to exploit or destroy them.


### The Resonance Cry
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:15:00-05:00

Moments after Vaelith Quorran's birth, amidst the chaos of Qlithar Prime's final hours, their first cry emitted a unique harmonic resonance that caused nearby Qlithari relics to momentarily activate. This phenomenon, unheard of in Qlithari history, was witnessed by a small group of survivors, including their mother, Lyssara Quorran, and High Archivist Trelan Vorthas. The resonance temporarily stabilized the crumbling environment of the birthing shelter, allowing the group to survive long enough to board an evacuee ship. This event was interpreted by some as a sign of Vaelith's destined connection to the ancient relics, while others feared it marked the beginning of an unknown and dangerous power. The resonance also left an imprint on the evacuee ship's systems, later aiding in the identification of Vaelith's unique energy signature.


### The Resonance Cry
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:15:00-05:00

Moments after Vaelith Quorran's birth, as the Shattering of Qlithar Prime tore through the planet, an unprecedented phenomenon occurred. In the chaos of seismic ruptures and atmospheric collapse, Vaelith emitted a powerful, harmonic resonance that reverberated across the remnants of Qlithar Prime. This event, later called the Resonance Cry, temporarily stabilized the collapsing environment within a small radius. The Cry was accompanied by a vivid bioluminescent glow radiating from Vaelith's body, which synchronized with the ancient Qlithari relics buried beneath the surface. Witnesses, including surviving members of the Qlithari Council and the elder scientist Saelith Voraan, interpreted the Cry as both a protective mechanism and a sign of Vaelith's deep connection to their species' lost heritage. The event allowed a small group of survivors to activate the 'Stellar Conflux Key,' a mechanism needed to access the biomechanical escape vessel Erythra, ensuring their survival.


### The Resonance Cry
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:15:00-05:00

Moments after Vaelith Quorran's birth, a catastrophic instability in Qlithar Prime's core caused seismic and electromagnetic disturbances across the dying planet. As their first cry echoed through the underground birthing chamber, an unexpected surge of energy erupted from Vaelith. This phenomenon, later named the 'Resonance Cry,' emitted a harmonic wave that synchronized with nearby Qlithari relics. The wave temporarily stabilized the collapsing chamber, shielding the surviving Qlithari elders and infants from immediate destruction. Though the moment was brief, the Resonance Cry hinted at Vaelith's unique connection to the ancient relics and their species' energy-based legacy, leaving the survivors awestruck and filled with fragile hope.


### The Awakening of the Conflux Imprint
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:45:00-05:00

Following the Resonance Cry, the harmonic energy emitted by Vaelith Quorran began interacting with the ancient Qlithari relics embedded in the evacuee ship's systems. The Stellar Conflux Key, a powerful artifact used to stabilize the ship's energy core, began to glow with an intense azure light. High Archivist Trelan Vorthas, who had dedicated his life to studying the relics, recognized this as an unprecedented event. The Conflux Key synchronized with Vaelith's unique energy signature, creating what would later be known as the 'Conflux Imprint.' This imprint altered the ship's navigation systems, ensuring a safe path through the chaotic remnants of Qlithar Prime's destruction. However, this synchronization also triggered a faint but detectable signal that would later draw the attention of the Vorrex Syndicate. The survivors, including Vaelith's mother Lyssara Quorran, viewed this as both a miraculous salvation and a potential harbinger of further danger. The event solidified Vaelith's perceived connection to the relics, marking them as a figure of great importance and setting the stage for their future challenges as both a beacon of hope and a target for those seeking the relics' power.


### The Imprint's First Echo
**Time**: 2000-01-16T00:45:00-05:00

Thirty minutes after The Resonance Cry, as the survivors prepared to leave the birthing shelter, the harmonic imprint left by Vaelith Quorran's cry began to interact with the evacuee ship's systems. High Archivist Trelan Vorthas, who had extensive knowledge of Qlithari relics, noticed that the ship's core—a fragment of the Stellar Conflux Key—began pulsing in synchrony with the resonance from the earlier cry. This interaction stabilized the evacuee ship's damaged systems, repairing critical navigation and atmospheric shielding functions. Lyssara Quorran, Vaelith's mother, realized the connection between her child's unique energy and the ancient technology. However, some survivors, fearing the unknown implications of this power, began to question whether Vaelith's presence might endanger them further. The event solidified Vaelith's perceived connection to the ancient relics, marking them as both a symbol of hope and a potential threat. This moment also planted the seeds of future divisions among the survivors regarding Vaelith's role in their species' survival.


### The Harmonic Storm
**Time**: 2000-01-16T01:00:00-05:00

Following the Collapse of the Resonant Spire, the massive release of harmonic energy created an unstable feedback loop within Qlithar Prime's atmosphere. This phenomenon, later named 'The Harmonic Storm,' manifested as vibrant auroras and violent energy surges across the planet. The storm disrupted evacuation routes, disabled key escape vessels, and caused several relics across the planet to activate unpredictably. During this chaos, Vaelith Quorran's parents, Aelora and Thynar, attempted to shield their newborn from the storm's effects by retreating deep into the research facility's harmonic chamber, a room designed to study relic resonance. To their astonishment, Vaelith exhibited an innate ability to stabilize the harmonic fluctuations in the chamber, temporarily neutralizing the storm's effects in their immediate vicinity. This unexpected event saved several researchers and evacuees who had sought refuge in the facility. The Harmonic Storm raged for hours, scattering fragments of the Resonant Spire further and embedding its glyphs into distant regions of the planet. Survivors later identified this moment as a critical turning point in Vaelith's life, as their unique connection to the harmonic energy became evident, setting the foundation for their later role as a stabilizing force for the Qlithari's survival.


### The Imprint Awakens
**Time**: 2000-01-16T03:00:00-05:00

Several hours after the evacuee ship carrying Vaelith Quorran and the last survivors of Qlithar Prime departed the dying planet, the ship's systems began to exhibit unusual behavior. The harmonic resonance left by Vaelith's cry had seemingly fused with the ship's core, causing subtle but significant changes to its functionality. The biometric locks on the ship's navigation systems recalibrated and aligned themselves to Vaelith's unique energy signature, making it impossible for anyone else to fully access the ship's controls without their presence. High Archivist Trelan Vorthas, noticing the changes, quickly identified the resonance pattern as one linked to ancient Qlithari relics, though the full implications were unclear. This event solidified the survivors' belief that Vaelith was intrinsically connected to their species' lost legacy. Meanwhile, Lyssara Quorran, overwhelmed by a mix of awe and fear, vowed to protect her child at all costs. The incident also caused a temporary malfunction in the ship's cloaking systems, exposing the evacuees to a brief but dangerous encounter with Vorrex Syndicate scout ships, which were patrolling the area for fleeing survivors. The survivors managed to evade capture, but the Syndicate marked the ship's energy signature, beginning their long pursuit of Vaelith.


### The Descent of the Stellar Conflux Key
**Time**: 2000-01-16T06:00:00-05:00

In the immediate aftermath of the Shattering of Qlithar Prime, the surviving members of the Qlithari, including Aelora and Thynar Quorran, scrambled to find a way off the crumbling planet. Among the chaos, the ancient Stellar Conflux Key, a massive relic buried deep beneath the surface, activated for the first time in centuries. This relic, long thought to be dormant, was triggered by the seismic energy of the planetary collapse and possibly by the Resonance Cry emitted by Vaelith Quorran at birth. The Key emerged from beneath the ruins of the Qlithari capital, its towering crystalline structure shimmering with energy as it established a tenuous connection to the orbiting living vessel, Erythra. Aelora and Thynar, along with a small group of survivors, navigated through collapsing terrain to reach the Key, using its energy field to ascend to safety aboard Erythra. This act not only saved their lives but also marked the beginning of the Exodus from Qlithar Prime, as the Stellar Conflux Key provided the first coordinated escape route for the scattered Qlithari. However, the activation of the Key sent a signal into deep space, alerting unknown forces, including the Vorrex Syndicate, to the Qlithari’s use of ancient technology.


### The Collapse of the Qlithari Council
**Time**: 2000-01-17

In the immediate aftermath of the Shattering, the Qlithari Council, the governing body of Qlithar Prime, was thrown into chaos. The Council, which had ignored warnings about the planet's unstable core, found itself overwhelmed with the consequences of its inaction. As survivors scrambled to evacuate amidst the tectonic destruction, the Council convened aboard a temporary orbital station. Heated arguments erupted among the remaining councilors, with some blaming each other for their complacency and others calling for immediate steps to organize the scattered Qlithari people. However, internal divisions deepened when it was revealed that some council members had secretly secured escape vessels for themselves and their families, leaving countless civilians stranded. This revelation led to the fracturing of the Council into factions, each with differing priorities: one group sought to preserve what remained of Qlithari culture and relics, while another prioritized survival at any cost, even if it meant abandoning certain traditions. The collapse of the Council marked the end of unified leadership for the Qlithari, laying the foundation for the disarray and isolation that would define their scattered diaspora. Vaelith Quorran's parents, Aelora and Thynar, distanced themselves from the political infighting, focusing instead on safeguarding the research facility's relics and ensuring their newborn's survival.


### The Fall of Aetherion Spire
**Time**: 2000-01-17

In the hours following the Shattering of Qlithar Prime, the Aetherion Spire, a towering structure that served as both the central hub of the Qlithari Council and a repository for ancient relics, succumbed to the planet-wide tectonic upheavals. The Spire, located in the capital city of Qlitharion, was a symbol of Qlithari unity and technological prowess. As the ground quaked violently, fissures split the foundation of the Spire, causing it to collapse in a cascade of debris and energy surges from the relics housed within. The destruction of the Spire not only signaled the complete disintegration of centralized leadership but also released an uncontrolled shockwave of resonance energy that echoed across the planet. The collapse claimed the lives of all remaining Council members, leaving the survivors leaderless and in disarray. Thynar Quorran, who had previously cautioned the Council about the dangers of over-mining, witnessed the distant collapse from the research facility and recorded the event as a historical marker. This moment reinforced the urgency for the survivors to rally around the Stellar Conflux Key and initiate the Exodus, marking the beginning of Vaelith Quorran's indirect role as a symbol of hope and survival.


### The Resonance Exodus
**Time**: 2000-01-17

Following the catastrophic Shattering of Qlithar Prime, the surviving Qlithari scrambled to organize an evacuation amidst widespread destruction and chaos. The Stellar Conflux Key, an ancient artifact buried deep within the ruins of Aetherion Spire, was hastily activated by a group of scientists and engineers led by Vaelith's parents, Aelora and Thynar Quorran. The artifact unleashed a harmonic energy field that temporarily stabilized the surrounding tectonic activity, creating a narrow window for survivors to board the living vessel Erythra. During this critical moment, the resonance energy emitted by Vaelith, still an infant, synchronized with the Conflux Key, amplifying its stabilization effect and allowing the survivors to escape. The evacuation was far from orderly; many perished in the chaos, and a significant portion of the Qlithari population was unable to reach the evacuation point in time. The Resonance Exodus marked the departure of approximately 15,000 survivors, leaving the ruined Qlithar Prime behind as their homeworld was consumed by its collapsing core. This event solidified Vaelith's symbolic role among the Qlithari as a figure of hope and marked the beginning of their journey aboard Erythra.


### The Collapse of the Qlithari Council
**Time**: 2000-01-17

As the Shattering of Qlithar Prime continued to devastate the planet, the Qlithari Council, the central governing body of the Qlithari people, convened in an emergency session at the Aetherion Spire to coordinate evacuation efforts. However, the catastrophic tectonic shifts caused by the planet's destabilized core reached the region, triggering the collapse of the Spire. The destruction killed most of the Council members, plunging the Qlithari into leaderless chaos. Surviving councilors, including the pragmatic but untrusted Minister Cevalyn Kroth, attempted to assume command of the evacuation, but infighting and mistrust among the survivors hindered efforts. The collapse of the Council marked the end of centralized leadership for the Qlithari, forcing individual groups to fend for themselves. Aelora and Thynar Quorran, with their newborn Vaelith, avoided the Spire's destruction due to their location in a remote research facility but were faced with the grim reality that there was no coordinated plan for survival. This disarray set the stage for the eventual fragmentation of the Qlithari people across the galaxy.


### The Exodus from Qlithar Prime
**Time**: 2000-01-20

In the immediate aftermath of the Shattering of Qlithar Prime, the surviving Qlithari scrambled to evacuate their broken homeworld. The planet's collapse had left it unstable, with its atmosphere rapidly deteriorating due to massive volcanic eruptions and toxic gas emissions. Aelora and Thynar Quorran, along with the newborn Vaelith, joined a small group of survivors at the research facility where ancient Qlithari relics were being studied. Using a partially functional relic known as the 'Stellar Conflux Key,' the researchers managed to activate an ancient Qlithari escape vessel buried beneath the facility. The vessel, later named 'Erythra,' was biomechanical in nature and had not been operational for centuries. As the group launched into space, they witnessed the final collapse of Qlithar Prime into a molten wasteland, its destruction scattering valuable meteorite minerals across the surrounding star systems. This exodus marked the beginning of the Qlithari diaspora. The loss of their homeworld and the meager number of survivors left profound scars on their culture and identity, with many believing the relics to hold the key to their species' future. Vaelith's survival aboard Erythra instilled in them an unshakable bond with the living vessel, which would grow into a lifelong partnership as they matured.


### The Binding of the Aetherial Nexus
**Time**: 2005-03-14

Vaelith Quorran, at the age of five, unintentionally activates a dormant Qlithari artifact known as the Aetherial Nexus, tethering their life-force to the relic. This bond grants them enhanced resonance abilities but at a significant cost: their vitality is now tied to the Nexus, which begins to deteriorate over time. This event marks the first time Vaelith becomes consciously aware of their unique connection to Qlithari technology and foreshadows their role as a pivotal figure in the restoration or collapse of their species.


### The Shardbond Revelation
**Time**: 2006-03-11

Vaelith Quorran, during their deepening connection with the relics aboard Erythra, unexpectedly experiences a profound and destabilizing vision. The vision emanates from an unactivated shard embedded within the vessel, revealing fragments of lost Qlithari knowledge and a cryptic warning about the fragility of their survival. This event significantly alters Vaelith's understanding of their bond with ancient Qlithari technology, intensifies their emotional ties to their heritage, and foreshadows the critical role the relics will play in their species' future. The event also leaves Vaelith physically and mentally drained, leading to tension among the survivors who grow wary of the increasing toll on their leader.


### The Veilborn Emergence
**Time**: 2006-05-18

During a perilous journey through the Aetherial Rift, Vaelith was engulfed by a mysterious anomaly known as the Veilborn Stream. Emerging from the encounter profoundly altered, Vaelith gained the ability to perceive and manipulate Veilborn Energies—a spectral force linked to the Qlithari's extinct past. This event heightened their connection to ancient relics but also burdened them with cryptic visions of a fractured future, deepening their resolve to restore their people while grappling with the existential dread of potential failure.


### The Echoing Void Confrontation
**Time**: 2006-07-21

Vaelith Quorran encountered a rogue fragment of the Qlithari Void Matrix while exploring the depths of the living vessel Erythra. This fragment, known as the Echoing Void, attempted to assimilate Vaelith into its chaotic energy field, threatening their life and mind. However, through their unique resonance abilities, Vaelith managed to stabilize the fragment, partially integrating its chaotic energy into themselves. This event marked a turning point in Vaelith's journey, as their connection to Qlithari relics deepened, but at the cost of an internal struggle to balance the destructive and stabilizing forces within them. It also hinted at the lingering dangers of Qlithari technology and the sacrifices needed to restore their civilization.


### The Fusing of the Aetherial Core
**Time**: 2007-11-02

During an experimental attempt to stabilize the living vessel Erythra, Vaelith Quorran inadvertently fused a fragment of their life-force with the ship's Aetherial Core. This act deepened their symbiotic connection to Erythra, amplifying both their ability to interface with Qlithari relics and their physical vulnerability tied to the ship's well-being. The event profoundly impacted Vaelith's identity, as they began to see themselves as both an individual and a living extension of Qlithari technology, defining their dual role as unifier and protector of their people.


### The Fracturing of Erythra
**Time**: 2010-08-19

A devastating malfunction aboard Erythra, the living vessel carrying the Qlithari survivors, caused a partial collapse of its bio-structure. Vaelith Quorran, now a young teenager, was at the heart of the crisis, forming an instinctive and unprecedented connection with Erythra’s core consciousness to stabilize it. While the survivors were saved, parts of the vessel were irrevocably damaged, and Erythra became more dependent on Vaelith for its continued functioning. This event deepened Vaelith’s sense of responsibility and isolation, while also revealing their unique abilities as a bridge between the Qlithari and their living technology.


### Discovery of the Last Qlithari Shard
**Time**: 2018-05-12

Vaelith Quorran discovers an ancient, sentient shard of Qlithar Prime, still imbued with the memories and essence of their lost civilization. The shard reveals cryptic insights into the events leading up to the Shattering and hints at a way to rebuild or restore a fragment of what was lost. This discovery ignites a sense of purpose in Vaelith, leading them to embark on a quest to understand their heritage and redefine their role as a potential savior or restorer of their species.
