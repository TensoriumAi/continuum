# Evaluation of Vaelith Quorran's Timeline

## Narrative Summary

Vaelith Quorran's timeline follows the journey of a former soldier-turned-scholar who is thrust into a conflict between ancient warring factions seeking control over a powerful artifact, the Obsidian Sigil. Born in the desolate Outlands, Vaelith rises to prominence through a combination of wit, bravery, and a thirst for knowledge. Their story unfolds across three distinct arcs: **The Outland Years**, where Vaelith struggles with identity and survival; **The Scholar's Ascent**, where they delve into forbidden knowledge and uncover the secrets of the Sigil; and **The Fractured Realms**, where they must confront the consequences of their choices while navigating alliances, betrayals, and personal loss.

The timeline spans roughly three decades, weaving themes of power, sacrifice, identity, and the cyclical nature of history. Vaelith evolves from a reluctant hero to a figure of legend, though their ultimate fate remains ambiguous.
