### Birth of Terrence 'Terry' Alden
**Time**: 1969-03-11T00:00:00-05:00

Beginning of Terrence 'Terry' Alden's story.


### The Rhythmic Observation
**Time**: 1969-03-12

The day after Terry's birth, nurse Margaret Lawson, still intrigued by the rhythmic nature of his cries, returned to check on him in the maternity ward. She observed that his movements, even in sleep, seemed to have a subtle synchronicity with the beeping of nearby medical monitors. Margaret mentioned this observation to Dr. Harold Mendez, who humorously suggested it might be a coincidence but asked her to keep a note of any unusual behavior. Meanwhile, Terry's mother, Elaine Alden, noticed that he seemed unusually calm when she hummed lullabies with consistent tempos. This led her to hum softly to him during feedings and diaper changes, which unintentionally began a daily ritual of rhythmic bonding between mother and child. This quiet interaction became a comforting routine for both, subtly reinforcing Terry's connection to patterns from the earliest days of his life.


### The Rhythmic Bonding Moment
**Time**: 1969-03-12

The day after Terry's birth, while still in the hospital, nurse Margaret Lawson noticed an unusual reaction from the newborn. During a quiet moment, she hummed a soft lullaby to soothe him, and to her amazement, his cries began to synchronize with the rhythm of her humming. Intrigued, she experimented with subtle shifts in tempo, and Terry's responses adapted, creating what felt like a rhythmic exchange between them. Margaret, deeply moved by this interaction, shared the experience with Terry's mother, who dismissed it as a coincidence but appreciated Margaret's care. Unbeknownst to anyone, this moment laid the foundation for Terry's future ability to connect with others through patterns and rhythms. It also forged an unspoken bond between Margaret and Terry, as she felt a unique sense of responsibility and curiosity about his development. Years later, Margaret would recall this moment fondly when she learned about Terry's mathematical achievements.
