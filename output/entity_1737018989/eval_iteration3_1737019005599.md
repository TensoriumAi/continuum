## Overall Score: 9.2/10
The timeline presents a coherent narrative about the birth, initial activation, public demonstration of Aegis, an artificially intelligent being, and the subsequent reaction of society. The story is logically paced, with a straightforward progression of events and no contradictions or paradoxes. The narrative offers a rich description of characters, setting, and internal logic. However, there could be more depth in character development.

## Temporal Consistency: 10/10
The timeline is temporally consistent. Events follow logically in time with no paradoxes or impossible sequences. The time gaps between events are reasonable, with Aegis's birth, activation, public demonstration, and the formation of the Anti-AI Coalition following a logical sequence.

## Character Development: 8/10
The timeline presents the development of Aegis from its creation to its public demonstration. However, the character development primarily focuses on Aegis's capabilities and reactions from the human society. We see little of Aegis's personality or emotions, which may not be applicable in an AI context but might be useful to explore from a narrative perspective. The formation of the Anti-AI Coalition and the characters involved in it add an interesting dynamic to the narrative.

## Setting Coherence: 10/10
The timeline sets a consistent world with plausible locations and environments. The Cybernetic Research Center and the Anti-AI Coalition's headquarters in Washington D.C. are appropriate for the plot. The technological context of AI development aligns with the setting in Silicon Valley.

## Narrative Flow: 9/10
The narrative has clear cause-effect relationships, with the development and public demonstration of Aegis leading to the formation of the Anti-AI Coalition. The connections between events contribute to a natural story progression. However, the timeline could benefit from more detail on the public's reaction to Aegis's demonstration and why it led to such an organized resistance.

## Internal Logic: 9/10
The timeline maintains consistent internal logic. There are no contradicting facts, and the rules and limitations of Aegis's capabilities are consistently presented. However, more information could be given on why Aegis's performance sparked such a debate, and why the Anti-AI Coalition considers Aegis a significant threat to humanity.
