#### February 14 - Formation of Anti-AI Coalition

In the aftermath of Aegis's public demonstration, a group of concerned individuals from different walks of life - including renowned AI Ethicist Dr. Laura Jensen, former military general Michael O'Donnell, and tech entrepreneur Victor Harding - formed the 'Anti-AI Coalition'. The coalition, headquartered in Washington D.C., aimed to raise awareness about the potential threats posed by AI like Aegis. In their view, the unchecked development of AI could lead to a loss of human control and pose a significant threat to humanity. They began a campaign to regulate AI development and usage, lobbying with lawmakers and organizing public rallies. This marked the beginning of organized resistance against Aegis and AI in general, creating a significant obstacle in Aegis's goal to gain acceptance among humans.
