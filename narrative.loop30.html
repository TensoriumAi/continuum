This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

 * Unordered lists, and:
  1. One
  1. Two
  1. Three
 * More

&gt; Blockquote

And **bold**, *italics*, and even *italics and later **bold***. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
   return foo + ':' + s;
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears

               <h3>Basic Formatting</h3>

               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Bold</strong>: <code>**Bold**</code></li>
                  <li><em>Emphasized</em>: <code>*Emphasized*</code></li>
                  <li>
                     <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
                        Strikethrough
                     </span>
                     : <code>~~Strikethrough~~</code>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Horizontal rules: <code>---</code> (three hyphens),
                     <code>***</code> (three asterisks),
                     or <code>___</code> (three underscores).
                  </li>
               </ul>

               <h3>Headings</h3>

               <p>
                  All heading levels (e.g. H1, H2, etc), are marked by <code>#</code> at the beginning of a line.
                  For example, an H1 is <code># Heading 1</code> and an H2 is <code>## Heading 2</code>.
                  This continues to <code>###### Heading 6</code>.
               </p>

               <h3>Links</h3>

               <p>
                  Links can be created using several methods:

                  </p><ul>
                     <li>Links can be <code>[inline](https://markdowntohtml.com)</code></li>
                     <li>Inline links can <code>[have a title](https://markdowntohtml.com "Awesome Markdown Converter")</code></li>
                     <li>
                        Also, there can be reference links that allow the URL to be placed later in the document:
                        <ul>
                           <li>Here is a <code>[reference link][markdowntohtml]</code> that links to this site.</li>
                           <li>References are case-insensitive (for example <code>[this link][MarkDownToHTML]</code> works).</li>
                           <li>References can also <code>[use numbers][1]</code>.</li>
                           <li>Or leave it empty and use the <code>[link text itself]</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Also, you can use relative links [like this](../blob/master/LICENSE.txt).</li>
                     <li>
                        URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links:
                        https://markdowntohtml.com or
                        <code>&lt;https://markdowntohtml.com&gt;</code>.
                     </li>
                  </ul>

                  URLs for reference links are somewhere later in the document like this:
<pre><code>[markdowntohtml]: https://markdowntohtml.com
[1]: https://markdowntohtml.com
[link text itself]: https://markdowntohtml.com</code></pre>
               <p></p>

            <h3>Images</h3>

            <p>
               Images can also be inline or use a reference style, similar to links.
               Simply prepend an exclamation point to turn the link into an image.
               For example:

</p><pre><code>Images with the full URL: ![alt text](https://placebear.com/300/300)

Or, a reference-style image: ![alt text][bears].

[bears]: https://placebear.com/300/300

               <h3>Lists (Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists)</h3>

               <p>
                  Lists are made by using indentation and a beginning-of-line marker to indicate a list item.
                  For example, unordered lists are made like this:
               </p>

               <pre>* One item
* Another item
  * A sub-item
    * A deeper item
  * Back in sub-item land
* And back at the main level
</pre>

               <p>
                  Unordered lists can use an asterisk (<code>*</code>), plus
                  (<code>+</code>), or minus (<code>-</code>) to indicate each
                  list item.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Ordered lists use a number at the beginning of the line.  The
                  numbers do not need to be incremented - this will happen for
                  you automatically by the HTML. That makes it easier to
                  re-order your ordered lists (in markdown) as needed.
               </p>

               <p>
                  Also, ordered and unordered lists can be nested within each other.
                  For example:
               </p>

               <pre>* One item
* Another item
  1. A nested ordered list
  1. This is the second item
    * And now an unordered list as its child
    * Another item in this list
  1. One more in the ordered list
* And back at the main level
</pre>

               <h3>Code and Syntax Highlighting</h3>

               <p>
                  Inline code uses <code>`backticks`</code> around it. Code blocks are either fenced by
                  three backticks (<code>```</code>) or indented four spaces. For example:
                  </p><pre><code>```
var foo = 'bar';

function baz(s) {
   return foo + ':' + s;
}
```</code></pre>
               <p></p>

               <h3>Blockquotes</h3>

               <p>
                  Use <code>&gt; </code> to offset text as a blockquote. For example:

                  </p><pre><code>&gt; This is some part of a blockquote.
&gt; Some more stuff.</code></pre>
               <p></p>

               Will produce:<br><br>

               <blockquote><p>
                  This is some part of a blockquote.
                  Some more stuff.
               </p></blockquote>
